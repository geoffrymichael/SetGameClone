//TODO: The basic population of the decks seems to be working. Next is the logic of picking and comparing cards


import UIKit


//TODO Lots of revision happened. I hope I just need some fine tuning on the matching logic. To work on next, is the errors I am getting in the matching function. Things seems to work on the first go around, but not on further rounds. I think I have missed clearing out a type. Everything copied out for core graphics implimentation

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    
    @IBOutlet weak var gameView: playingCardView!
    
    @IBAction func drawThreeButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
        gameView.drawThree()
    }
    
    @IBOutlet weak var scoreLabel: UILabel!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        
        gameView.newGame()
        
    }
    
    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()
        changeScore()
